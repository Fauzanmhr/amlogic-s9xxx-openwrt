**Modified for My Setup**

**Tested Hardware:**
- **WeChip V9** (S905X3 using `x96-air-gb` DTB)
- **B860H V1/V2** (S905X using `B860h` DTB)
- **Akari AX512** (S905X using `P212` DTB)

**Note:** If you'd like to try this setup, please use the **"build-openwrt-with-imagebuilder"** option in the **Actions Tab**. This is the only part I've modified; everything else remains default as provided by Ophub, as I am not familiar with further customizations. Before running the workflow, please follow the settings shown in the image below:
